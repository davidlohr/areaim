# The disk tests in the AIM-7 test consist of three groups:
# basic block I/O tests, the same tests with an added sync,
# and the sync I/O tests. Each test determines file size from a
# global variable, disk_iteration_count.
# 
# There are two configuration variables that control this,
# FILESIZE and POOLSIZE  (specified in kilobytes or megabytes).
# If POOLSIZE is zero, each child will write or read a total of
# FILESIZE bytes. If POOLSIZE is non-zero, child file size is
# equal to FILESIZE + (POOLSIZE/number_of_children). Thus when
# POOLSIZE is non-zero, I/O per child will be reduced on each
# increase in child count.
# 
# For example, specifying a FILESIZE of 10K and a POOLSIZE of
# 100K will result in a single child creating a 110K byte file
# on each disk device listed. Two children will create a 60K
# file, etc. 24 children will create a 14K file, consuming
# 328KB per disk device.
#
# The file and poolsize values can be specified here, or
# in the workfile. Values in the workfile will over write
# these values
FILESIZE 10k
POOLSIZE 1m
