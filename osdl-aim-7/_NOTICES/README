This is a reworking of the AIM performance tests for the 
benefit of the Linux community, and others who may be interested.

This version of the test should work in an identical fashion
to AIM, see README.aim for the details. 

This version of the test is not known to be POSIX-compliant, 
nor is it known to work on other operating systems, 
due to lack of knowledge and test environment. 
Contributions to make the test more portable appreciated. 

------------------
Instructions and warnings. 

1. The files 
	fakeh.tar
	aim_*.sh
	true
	
    Must be in your current working directory when running the test.
	If you do a 'make install' the installer will place all the
	needed stuff under (DESTDIR)/share/reaim

    The 'reaim' binary will be installed in (DESTDIR)/bin. 
	This directory must be in your PATH. 

2. With no options, reaim with run 1 to 5 users with the default workfile.

3. All options can be specified three ways:
	- default 
	- command line
	- reaim.config file. 

   Options in the reaim.config file are named in ALL CAPS. Sigh.

------------------
Alterations from the old test:

1. The test function invocation has been changed - this
	was done to allow possible reuse of LTP test cases.

	Old:
	static int mul_long(char *argv, Result * res)
	New:
	static int mul_long(int argc, char **argv, Result * res)
	
	register_test() has been altered to match. 

2. The old build environment has been removed, and replaced
	with a more standard GNU autoconf build.

	- will need some work to make this portable
	
3. libltp.a has been included. 
	- using the forker() function to replace aim_fork()
	- using the tst_sig() function for signal capture()
	- code re-use good

4. Same test can be run in AIM9 mode (singleuser) or AIM7 

5. The static arrays have been removed, the test list is now
	a linked list. 

	- processes per user is changeable on command line ('jobs')

6. Signal handler uses the wait() macros



----------------------------------
Options
---------------------------------
options with no arguments

--verbose,-v		- extra output to console. 
--crossover,-c		- increment users until jobs/minute/user < 1.0
				--endusers will be ignored
--quick, -q		- increment users until jobs/second/user < 1.0
				sets --crossover
--multiuser, -m		- Default. AIM7 style
--oneuser, -o		- AIM9 style. each test runs in sequence for 10 
				seconds
--timeroff, -t		- Do not use adaptive timer for load increment
--brief, -b		- Generate a brief results file (stp_data.txt)

options with optional arguements


--debug, -d<level>	- level of debug output (file is /tmp/reaim.log)
			 1 is default, 2 is more, 3 is tons 
options that require argument

--startusers, -s 	- starting user count. default 1
--endusers, -e		- ending user count. default 5
--increment, -i 	- increment - will be changed by adaptive timer
--jobs, -j		- processes per user. Default 100. All tests
				in workfile will be run once if this
				value < size of test list in workfile
--list, -l		- specify a config file. default is /usr/local/reaim/config
--file, -f		- specify a workfile, default is /usr/local/reaim/workfile
-x 			- run until the maxjobs rate declines 
			TODO - find a non-coliding short name for this option
